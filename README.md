# Description of the project

**I analyzed the Adult Census Income Dataset (adult11.csv) from Kaggle using Python and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to identify patterns and relationships in the data.**

# Process of the analysis

**First, I divided the Adult Census Income Dataset into categorical and numerical data for better analysis. Then, I explored the dataset by creating various visualizations, such as box plots, violin plots, error bars, histograms, and heatmaps, to identify trends and relationships between features. Additionally, I performed linear regression to analyze correlations and gain deeper insights into the data.**

# How to run my code

**In order to run my code on another computer, the following steps are required:**

1. Clone the repository from GitHub (git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
cd your_project).
2. Create a virtual environment (python -m venv venv 
On Mac or Linux use: source venv/bin/activate  
On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate).
3. Install dependences (pip install -r requirements.txt)
4. Run the main script to generate the results (python main.py). The output files will be saved in the project directory. 

# Notes

1. Ensure you have Python 3.13 and pip installed.
